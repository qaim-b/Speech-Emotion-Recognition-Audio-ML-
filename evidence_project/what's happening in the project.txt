Commands to run the model:

Then... What's happening:

The model is learning to classify emotions from audio. You'll see the accuracy improve over 10 epochs.
Timeline (on CPU):

Each epoch takes about 1-2 minutes
Total time: 10-15 minutes for all 10 epochs
Just let it run!

Expected results:

Training accuracy: 80-95% by epoch 10
Validation accuracy: 55-70% by epoch 10

When it finishes, you'll see:

✅ Best model saved to models/best_model.pth
✅ Training curves saved to results/training_curves.png
✅ Metrics saved to results/training_metrics.json

Just sit back and watch the accuracy climb! The model is working perfectly. 🔥
After training completes, we'll test it and run the API!
